Lesson 3

- When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

When working from multiple computers or collaborating with other users.
However, it makes sense to use a remote repository simply because of the risk of hardware failure/loss if a repository only exists locally.

- Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

Pulling changes from a remote might overwrite changes one has made locally.
Therefore, pulling should be deliberate and it is prudent to have a clean working tree as well.
